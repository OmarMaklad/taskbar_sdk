Trackbar SDK Architecture Design:

1. Sensor Abstraction Layer:
   - Methods: connectToSensor, startSensor, getDataPoint, stopSensor

2. Sensor Controllers:
   - RadarSensorController
   - Implement methods from the abstraction layer
   - Use communication interfaces for sensor interaction

3. Communication Interface:
   - BLE Communication Manager
   - Handle communication with sensors

4. Data Processing:
   - Process raw sensor data
   - Apply algorithms for meaningful results

5. Client Application (Flutter):
   - Utilize SDK methods for sensor interaction
   - UI components for user interaction

6. SDK Core Logic:
   - Implement the sensor abstraction layer
   - Manage communication, data processing, and interactions

7. SDK Configuration:
   - Allow clients to set preferences
   - Configure data processing, communication, etc.

8. Error Handling and Logging:
   - Log errors and events
   - Provide meaningful error messages for troubleshooting

9. Future Expansion:
   - Designed for scalability and addition of new sensor types
